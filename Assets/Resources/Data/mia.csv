Noah,Hey! How's it going， superstar? I couldn't help but reach out and see how your first day of shooting went. I hope it was everything you imagined and more!,,
player,"
Noah， it was absolutely incredible! The energy on set was electric， and I felt like I was living a dream. I can't thank you enough for getting me this opportunity. It's everything I've ever wanted.",,
Noah,That's amazing to hear! You were born to shine on that set， and I knew it from the moment I saw you.  I've been thinking about swinging by the movie set to see how everything's going. Would it be alright if I visit you? Seeing you thrive and live your passion brings me so much joy. Congratulations on making it this far!,,
player,That would be awesome! I'd love to have you come and see what we've been up to. It'll be great to catch up and show you firsthand how this whole production is coming together.,,
Noah,And---brace yourself for a wild ride. Because my delightful friend， Mia， you met her before in the cafe， somehow caught wind of our connection and has cooked up a spicy misunderstanding.,,
player,Misunderstanding? What do you mean by that?,,
Noah,She's under the impression that there's some epic love story brewing between us. Cue the dramatic music! Anyway I am worried she may cause some trouble for you. She is a star， that’s true， but also a troublemaker，a big one.,,
player,Noah， bring it on! I may not have the paparazzi on speed dial， but I've got a spirit that can't be shaken. Fame or no fame， I won't let Mia's misconceptions intimidate me. I'm here to shine and show the world what I'm capable of.,,
Noah,Well， well， well， look at you， Miss Fearless. I admire your confidence! Just remember， if things get a bit too crazy， I'm here to back you up. Together， we'll handle the spotlight and keep our focus on the work.,,
