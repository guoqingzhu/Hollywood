Noah,Hey，buddy! Long time no see! How's life treating you?
audition director-Mark,Noah，my man! Great to see you too，bro! Life's been a rollercoaster，you know how it is in this crazy town. What's the latest scoop with you? And who is this beauty here？
Noah,Oh， you know me， always hustling and chasing dreams. And this is the newbie actress I mentioned before. [player]， I want you to meet someone who could potentially change the course of your career. This is Mark， a legendary figure in the Hollywood scene. Mark， meet [player]， the incredible newbie actress I've been telling you about.
player,Thank you， Noah. I'm both nervous and excited to meet you， Mark. I've heard you are doing an amazing work here. It's an honor to have this opportunity to meet you.
audition director-Mark,The pleasure is all mine. This big star can’t stop talking about you.
Noah,Yes. I really believe she's got that special spark， you know? And I can't shake off this feeling that she's perfect for the role in this upcoming movie.
audition director-Mark,I am listening.
Noah,But here's the thing， she's a bit hesitant about auditions， gets all shaky and nervous. So， I was wondering， could you do me a solid and put in a good word for her with the big director? Maybe we can skip the whole audition process and get her straight into the role. What do you say， buddy? Can you work your magic?
audition director-Mark,Noah my man， you're putting me in a tough spot here.  I appreciate your belief in her talent. But skipping the audition process is a bold move.
Noah,My dear partner in crime! You know we've been through some epic adventures together in this crazy Hollywood journey. From red carpet premieres to late-night brainstorming sessions， we've had each other's backs. And now， I've stumbled upon this diamond in the rough， this rising star named [player].
audition director-Mark,Alright， you silver tongue movie star， you've convinced me! Consider this favor officially granted. Let's shake things up and give Lily the opportunity she deserves. I'll set up that private audition， just for her， where she can show me what she's made of. But remember， my friend， she's still got to bring her A-game. Follow me here， young lady.
player,Wow， I can’t believe that worked.
Noah,I just helped open the door. But here's the thing， my dear: Hollywood is not just about talent; it's also about the connections and relationships we build. This industry thrives on social networks and collaborations. It is the true magic here. And you've witnessed it firsthand now.
