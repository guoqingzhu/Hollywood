Noah,Well， that's a wrap! You did it， ! The movie is in the can， and I couldn't be prouder of what you've accomplished. I'm grateful to have shared this journey with you. Now， let's celebrate our hard work and get ready for the next chapter.
player,Wait… Is that Mia?
Mia,Well， well， if it isn't the little up-and-comer. I must say， darling， you surprised us all. I didn't think you had it in you to hold your own in this industry.
Noah," Oh， Mia， it's so kind of you to grace us with your condescending presence. I guess even big stars have time to observe the ""little up-and-comers，"" huh?"
player,Alright， let's keep it civil here. We're all professionals， and there's no need for any unnecessary drama.
Mia,Oh， always the peacemaker. But let's be real， darling. Your little friendship with Noah was just a stepping stone for him， wasn't it? A way to ride the coattails of fame.
player,You couldn't be more wrong. My friendship with Noah has been a genuine source of support and inspiration. We've built each other up， and our success is a result of hard work and talent， not some cheap shortcut.
Noah,That's right，Mia. [player]'s talent speaks for itself. She earned her place in this industry through sheer dedication and skill. There's no need to belittle her accomplishments.
Mia,Well， we'll see how long that talent lasts， won't we? The spotlight can be a fickle thing， my dear. You'll soon realize that you're just a flash in the pan. But mark my words， little starlet， the industry can be a cruel place. Enjoy your moment while it lasts.
